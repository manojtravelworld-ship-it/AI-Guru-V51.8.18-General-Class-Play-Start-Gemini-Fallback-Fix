/**
 * Where must "Play" start?
 *
 * Bug this replaces (reported against V51.8.17): the student opens page 7 in the textbook pane and
 * presses Play, and the classroom jumps back to page 1 (again and again).
 *
 * Why: the page-jump box can point at a physical PDF page that has NO extracted paragraph (front matter,
 * a diagram-only page, a scanned page). `goToPage` then parks the lesson cursor on the nearest PRECEDING
 * paragraph (often a page-1 title paragraph) and only remembers "page 7" in a separate display override.
 * Play cleared that override and taught the cursor paragraph, so the pane snapped to the preceding page.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  1. If the student picked a page (override), start at the first paragraph ON that page.
 *  2. If that page has no paragraph, start at the first paragraph AFTER it (teaching only moves forward).
 *  3. If nothing follows it, use the last paragraph (end of book) and say so.
 *  4. With no override, the visible cursor paragraph is authoritative.
